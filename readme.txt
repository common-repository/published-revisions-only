== Description ==

Published Revisions Only disables revisioning prior to a post being published. Autosaves and revisions made after publication are stored.

Basically, I wanted to have a record of revisions that have gone public, but I didn't want every working version.

== Installation ==

Unzip into plugins directory or install using handy-dandy Plugin Repository integration into Wordpress.

There are no options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this play nice with other plugins? =

It's quite possible that this plugin will not play nice with other plugins that modify Wordpress' revisioning. I've had no problem with GD Press Tools, but other than that I don't know.  Please report any conflicts to me.  I'll list incompatible plugins here.

= Where do you respond to support issues? =

The best place to leave comments or issues is at the plugin site: http://www.kingrat.us/plugins/published-revisions-only

I do not monitor the Wordpress.org support forums, so any problems left there are likely to have untimely responses.
